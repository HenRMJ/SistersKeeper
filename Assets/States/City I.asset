  storyText: "You know how dangerous finding your sister is going to be, especially
    in a place like this. But the faster you find her, the faster you can you leave.
    You make your way into the city without hesitation, hoping that somebody knows
    something. \L\LCommunicating with the locals is going to be a challenge, even
    with your Universal Translator. You\u2019re more than certain this planet isn\u2019t
    in the database, but you have hope that someone will be willing and able to callibrate
    it for you and add it in."
