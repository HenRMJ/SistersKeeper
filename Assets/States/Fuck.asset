  storyText: "You raise your middle finger, thinking back to all the things he said
    earlier. The action was probably childish, but you knew he wouldn\u2019t be able
    to here you. And besides, he was acting a bit like a child earlier, heprobably
    deserved this.\nHis pained screams morph into screams of anger as he starts dragging
    himself towards you with what energy he still had left, leaving a trail of blood
    in his wake. Mere inches from you, he collapses onto the floor, limp and lifeless
    from the blood loss. \nHis determination even moments from death was frightening,
    especially considering the ongoing situation."
