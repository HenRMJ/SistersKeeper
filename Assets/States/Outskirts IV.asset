  storyText: "A robotic voice comes from the earbuds. \u201CThe device is now on.
    Pick an option from the display and speak it aloud to begin.\u201D The callibration
    device projects a bright blue holographic screen in front of you listing all
    the options. \u201CCallibrate.\u201D The screen disappears and the voice starts
    again. \u201CThe callibration process can take up to thirty minutes. Make sure
    you have a native speaker with you. When you are ready, signal the native speaker
    to begin.\u201D You give the child a thumbs up, and the hologram switches on
    again as they talk. A holograph of a sun appears first before the child makes
    a noise, causing the image to quickly shift to one of a moon. This process continues
    a while with various images before the machine suddenly stops."
