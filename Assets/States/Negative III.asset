    His mood has soured quickly just from you opening your mouth. \n\n\u201DI don\u2019t
    give a fuck how long you need! This was supposed to be a scanning mission, and
    I don\u2019t like the fact that we\u2019re on a restricted planet, even if it
    is just for military and commerical! Now. A week. How does that sound?\u201D
    \n\n\u201DA week\u2019s fine by me.\u201D Rivers answered, looking over to Hafinson
    for their answer. Hafinson silently nodded in agreement. Are you gonna say something
