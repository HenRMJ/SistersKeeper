  storyText: "The intergrity of the ship is quickly falling. That much is obvious
    as the hull splits almost under your feet, separating you from the rest of the
    ship. \LYour stomach churns with anxiety as you\u2019re spun violently in the
    air, almost like you were in a less fun carnival ride. You manage to glance a
    glimpse of the rest of the ship, but you can\u2019t make out which direction
    it\u2019s going. Hell, you\u2019re spinning so fast that you can\u2019t even
    tell which direction is up anymore. \nYou might could get better control and
    sight of the ship if you let go, but you\u2019ll also be loosing what little
    safety you have. What do you do?"
  optionOne: Let go
  optionTwo: Keep holding on
