  storyText: "You finally pull yourself up, using the wall as a stabilizer, making
    your way to the captain. Despite him being an ass earlier, you were still going
    to be the better person. \u201CP-please!! Pull me out!\u201D The captain extends
    the arm that\u2019s still intact as you approach. You grab onto it tightly and
    start dragging him with as much strength as you can muster. The fire starts to
    catch up to you as you do, and you try to move faster, but it reaches the captain\u2019s
    clothes and sets them ablaze. He starts convulsing and twisting in an attempt
    to put it out, his breathing starting to get more laboured before he falls limp,
    his grasp on you loosening. The room was starting to smell a bit like coppery
    beef.....or was it pork? It didn\u2019t smell good either way."
