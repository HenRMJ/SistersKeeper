  storyText: "You try to brace yourself too late, and the force of your body colliding
    with the water is comparable to landing full force on concrete. You attempt to
    yell as you slowly sink under, but the only thing you accomplish is flooding
    your lungs with water. You feel trapped by the warm water surrounding you, and
    the spinning is still affecting you. You aren\u2019t sure which way is up. You
    try your best not to panic, and after what feels like hours, your sinking from
    the impact finally slows. It feels like you\u2019re simply drifting slowly through
    the water as you finally are able to make your way up towards the surface, swimming
    as fast as you possibly can. You feel your lungs burning from how long you\u2019ve
    been holding your breath, panting heavily as you surface."
