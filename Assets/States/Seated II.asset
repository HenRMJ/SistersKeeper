  storyText: "You brace yourself for impact, tucking your head between the bars over
    your shoulders and curling up as small as you could. This is what the safety
    video you were forced to watch before taking flight instructed in case of something
    like this occuring, but you never thought you would have to use it. The chance
    of you surviving this was slim to none, but you would try your best. \n\nIf you
    died, you would never have the change to meet your sister unless she was in the
    afterlife, so you were damned determined not to die like this. You closed your
    eyes tightly and prayed silently to whatever was out there."
