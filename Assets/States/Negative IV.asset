  storyText: "\u201COkay, then go look for your sister! But we\u2019re leaving in
    a week, and if you don\u2019t like it, you can find another way off this planet!\u201D
    The captain sounded like if you said one wrong word, and he\u2019d leave you
    behind either way. \n\nA week really isn\u2019t that much time, but it\u2019s
    better than nothing. But on the other hand, you weren\u2019t sure how long it
    would take for the captain to find out about your lie. It\u2019s probably in
    your best interest to leave now before he does find out. "
