    timed or anything so you can just... like wait...\n\nOh, by the way clicking
    \u201CQ\u201D quits the game. Don\u2019t worry, I know you like to click random
    buttons so the game saves automatically. Also achievements will unlock as you
    progress through the game so check up on those from time to time. Also, you can
    turn off and on the voice over by click on the little speech bubble and sound
    effects by clicking on the speaker icon.\n\nAnyways press 1 whenever you\u2019re
