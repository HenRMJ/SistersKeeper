  storyText: "The force of the blast knocks you off your feet and back into the hallway,
    thick smoke trickling out the doorway. A loud scream breaks through the wall
    of smoke, and you try your best to stand. You cast a disoriented glance back
    to the captain, squinting to see him through the smoke. He was laying on the
    ground, his face is covered in shrapnel, small pieces having embedded themselves
    in his skin, small trails of blood oozing from the cuts. The most notable thing,
    though, was his left arm was almost entirely missing and blood was pouring from
    the stump left behind, small scraps of flesh and bone littering the ground nearby.
    \u201CHelp me!\u201D The captain sounded desperate and in pain, looking up at
    you with a pleading expression."
