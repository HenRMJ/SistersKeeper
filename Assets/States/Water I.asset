  storyText: "You decide to go for the water and make a running leap as you launch
    yourself out of the wreckage. You take a quick look around as you fall, hoping
    to catch a glimpse of the rest of the ship. It\u2019s falling directly to the
    right of you, about one or two miles away. It\u2019s hard to tell the distance
    with everything going on. You turn your attention back to the water as you tilt
    yourself side to side in an attempt to direct yourself towards it. \u201CRight,
    right, right-\u201D You mumble to yourself, nailing in where you saw the ship
    falling. \n\nThe water is quickly approaching, and you\u2019re less than twenty
    feet away."
