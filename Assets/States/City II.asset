  storyText: "You make it to the city, and note that the locals fall into the uncanny
    valley. Mostly human looking, but definitely off enough to not be. Their skin
    was courser, almost scaly, but not to the point of a reptiles. They\u2019re taller
    than the average human, but also slimmer, with no nose and protrusions on either
    side of their neck, almost like a bearded dragon, or maybe fish fins? You can\u2019t
    help but think back to how older media always protrayed alien life and compare
    them to what you were seeing. It\u2019s strange how little difference there is
    between humans and other highly evolved life forms in reality. Your sister had
    always loved those movies...the idealized depiction of space exploration was
    probably the reason she became a surveyer."
