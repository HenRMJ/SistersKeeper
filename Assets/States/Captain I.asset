  storyText: "You decide that the captain would most likely know more about the ship
    then anyone else, unbuckling your seat. Nanoseconds later, another blast makes
    its way from the engine room. You\u2019re running on pure adrenaline and you
    swear you can hear your heart from how much it\u2019s pounding. You rush to the
    engine room, immediately starting to explain. \n\n\u201DCaptain, something\u2019s
    blinking on the panel!! I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s another engine!\u201D
    You try your best to yell over the thunderous sound. \u201CYou think I don\u2019t-?!\u201D
    The captain starts to respond, but is cut off by another loud explosion from
    right behind him. "
