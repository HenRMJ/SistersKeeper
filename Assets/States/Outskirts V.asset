  storyText: "The voice starts up a moment after. \u201CCallibration in progress.
    Translations may not be one hundred precent accurate with this process, and may
    not fully cover the language you are trying to translate. Species with voices
    lower than ten hertz or higher than eighty kilohertz may not be able to translate.\u201D
    The voice explains as the child stares at you without blinking, waiting for it
    to finish. Did this species even have eyelids? You suppose that isn\u2019t really
    important, but the child hasn\u2019t blinked once the entire time you\u2019ve
    been with them. Finally, the mask gives two low pitched noises, and the child
    responds. The robotic voice of the translator begins, dull lights on the front
    of the mask picking up the wave length of the child\u2019s voice. "
