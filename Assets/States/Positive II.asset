  storyText: "\u201CHafinson! Rivers!\u201D The captain half shouted to grab the
    attention of both the engineer and the pilot, who look over at the call. \n\n\u201DYes,
    sir?\u201D They both respond in unison, almost like it was planned. \n\n\u201DWe\u2019ve
    been flying for a while. What do you say we take a week of shore leave before
    setting off again?\u201D The captain\u2019s mood seemed to have improved as he
    asked, waiting for anyone\u2019s input. \n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on the matter?"
