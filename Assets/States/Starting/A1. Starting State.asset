  storyText: "After travelling for 4 months in space you finally arrived at the Krestar
    System. Your sister is still missing. You were hoping you would hear something
    on your way to the Krestar System but it\u2019s been silent. \n\nThe last conversation
    you remember having with your sister was about how excited she was. Her company
    Langly Corp has never let her lead an expedition before. She recounted that it
    was a bit strange that the mission was so secretive. She wasn\u2019t even allowed
    to tell you exactly where she was going. Before her departure she did say she
    was travelling to a planet within Krestar\u2019s Astroid belt."
