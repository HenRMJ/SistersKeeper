  storyText: "It\u2019s been a long four months of space travel, and you\u2019ve
    finally arrived at the Krestar System. As much as you were hoping to hear word
    about your sister, she still remains M.I.A, and no updates have been received.
    \n\nThe last conversation you can remember having with her was about how excited
    she was to lead her first expedition and how strange she found it that they had
    told her to keep it on the down low. She couldn\u2019t even tell you where she
    was going, but upon her departure, she let it slip that their destination was
    a planet located around the astroid belt in the center of the Krestar System. "
