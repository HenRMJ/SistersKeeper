  storyText: "Finding your sister is the most important thing at this moment, but
    if something happens to you before you find her, she most likely would never
    be found. Not that it would really matter by that point...you decide it safer
    to stay on the outskirts of town, where you spot some smaller buildings that
    were most likely living spaces of some sort a bit away.\n\r\nCommunicating with
    the locals is going to be a challenge, even with your Universal Translator. You\u2019re
    more than certain this planet isn\u2019t in the database, but you have hope that
    someone will be willing and able to callibrate it for you and add it in."
