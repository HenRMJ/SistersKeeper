  storyText: "The water\u2019s hot, but not quite enough to burn. The only real pain
    you feel is from the burns on your hands. You pull yourself up onto the shore
    and look down at your hands, which are peeling something horrible. \u201CWell,
    that\u2019s probably going to get infected...\u201D You mumble to yourself and
    glance around to get a sense of where you are. You see a trail of debris heading
    towards the ship and can\u2019t help but wonder about what happened to the rest
    of the crew. You also see a large hill nearby that piques your curiosity. \n\nWhere
    do you decide to go?"
  optionOne: Head to the wreckage / back to beginning
  optionTwo: See if you can find signs of... anything on top of the hill
  optionThree: Repeat line
