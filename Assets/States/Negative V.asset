  storyText: "\u201CGreat, I didn\u2019t want you back on my ship anyway. Now get
    the fuck off.\u201D The captain is fuming at this point, and Hafinson gives you
    a look that says you better listen. You cross your arms with a huff and go to
    gather your belongs in a bit of a rush. You have unlimited time to find your
    sister, but you also have no way off the planet. You suppose that\u2019s a bridge
    you\u2019ll have to cross later. \n\nAfter stepping off the ship, you see the
    outline of the metropolis close by. Lying to the captain got you this close to
    a city, at least, but it\u2019s completely retricted to all humans. What will
    you do?"
  optionOne: Be safe and travel on the outskirts of the city.
  optionTwo: Go straight into the city.
  optionThree: Repeat line
