  storyText: "Congrats!! You\u2019ve finished the game!! Fun fact, this is the shortest
    ending you can get, so if it\u2019s the first one you found, that\u2019s pretty
    special!\n\nBecause it\u2019s so short, I\u2019m just gonna take you back to
    the beginning of the game. It\u2019s pretty quick to get back to where you were
    if you want to try again!! If not, you can just.....close the game and start
    again another time..... "
