  storyText: "X14D5 is an unexplored planet close to Krestar\u2019s sun, right on
    the edge of the Goldilocks Zone. It\u2019s just close enough to this edge that
    the planet is only a few degrees away from being uninhabitable. You know how
    brutal the environment of this planet could be, but maybe that\u2019s why Langly
    Corp kept the mission a hush hush. It could be bad for them if it got out they
    were putting their workers in such dangerous situations for their own profit
    without a second thought to the consequences. It\u2019s possible she could be
    there. \n\nWould you like to land here, or learn more about the first planet?"
  optionOne: Learn about the first planet
  optionTwo: "\u201CTake us to X14D5\u201D (you cannot go back)"
  optionThree: Back
