  storyText: "Suddenly, the side wall of the engine room rips off, allowing a gush
    of hot air from outside to flood the area. Your lungs are burning and you feel
    like you\u2019re being slow roasted. You grab onto the nearest wall to keep from
    being sucked out of the ship. The metal\u2019s so hot your certain you\u2019ll
    end up with third degree burns, at the least. You were suddenly thankful for
    all the adrenaline that was numbing the pain of your hand enough where letting
    go wasn\u2019t an option. Letting go meant being jettisoned out of a burning
    ship, and that really didn\u2019t sound like a fun time."
