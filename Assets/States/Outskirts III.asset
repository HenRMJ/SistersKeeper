  storyText: "The person standing in front of you is a child, that much you can tell,
    even if they are almost as tall as you. Probably around five foot, six inches,
    if you had to guess. Two protrusions on their neck start moving a bit like fish
    fins as they open their mouth, letting out a series of low pitched noises. They
    don\u2019t seem to be scared of you, and you realize this is probably the only
    chance you\u2019ll get to callibrate your translator. You pull it out, along
    with the callibration device. The alien standing across from you watches curiously
    before seemingly realizing what it is and sits down, crossing its legs, much
    like a human child. You mirror their actions and sit as well, straping the mask
    like translator to your face and inserting the earbuds attached to it."
