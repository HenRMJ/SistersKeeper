    so I\u2019m aware you said you had no clue about which planet we\u2019re heading
    to, but we\u2019re running out of fuel-\u201D\n\nYou cut them off before they
    could finish. \u201CThat\u2019s fine, we only have to check these two by the
    belt.\u201D\n\n\u201DYou don\u2019t seem to understand. There\u2019s two planets.
    We only have enough fuel to stop at one.\u201D The captain seems annoyed at having
    been interrupted."
