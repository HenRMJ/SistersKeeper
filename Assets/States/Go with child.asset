  storyText: "You follow the child through the alleys behind the buildings before
    you reach an entrance on a building that looked a bit newer. The door was cracked
    open just a bit, probably from this child sneaking out. They open it the rest
    of the way and motions you to enter. You hesitantly step inside and see another
    local laying across a futuristic looking couch and watching something on a large
    screen. The child enters behind you. \u201CHey, djfbe, I found another human!
    I think they\u2019re looking for the female we rfdsf!\u201D The local looked
    up at you, standing up and quickly pulling the child behind them. \u201CWho are
    you?\u201D The adult demanded, towering over you. They were at least three feet
    taller than the child, and looked untrusting."
