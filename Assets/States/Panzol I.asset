  storyText: "Panzol is a plant inhabitable by a deceptive and dangerous alien race.
    Many attempts have been made to set up communications, as well as trading offers,
    but none have succeeded. To send their crew to Panzol would look bad on Langly
    Corp., and could possibly tarnish their reputation. It would make sense they
    told your sister to stay silent if they sent her and her expedition here, so
    there\u2019s a chance she got captured if they landed.\n\nShe could be here,
    and she could be in danger.\n\nWould you like to land here, or learn more about
    the second planet?"
  optionOne: Learn about the second planet
  optionTwo: "\u201CCaptain, take us to Panzol.\u201D"
  optionThree: Back
