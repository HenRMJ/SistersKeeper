  storyText: "The captain walks over to the helm of the ship, ordering the pilot
    to set course to X1465. The pilot nods and pushes a few buttons, and it seems
    like smooth sailing from there. \u201CPreparing for landing!\u201D The pilot
    declares after a few minutes, flipping a switch. During the descent, loud noises
    start echoing from the pilot\u2019s console.\nYou, not being able to help your
    curiosity, walk over to ask what\u2019s happening. \u201CThe engine\u2019s over
    heating! This is gonna be close!\u201D The pilot answers, trying their best to
    keep a level head as they worked. \u201CHafinson!\u201D The captain barked in
    the direction of the engineer, demanding their attention. \u201CGo refill the
    coolant on Engine Six! STAT!\u201D"
