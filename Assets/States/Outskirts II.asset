  storyText: "After you reach the buildings, you duck around the corner of one to
    hide. You note that this area definitely doesn\u2019t look as high end as the
    rest of the city as you watch the locals go about their business. You didn\u2019t
    do much research on the species that inhabit the planet, but from afar, they
    look exactly like taller, slimmer humans.\L\LYou hear footsteps behind you and
    turn around in an internal panic, finding yourself face to face with a local.
    You know you most likely aren\u2019t supposed to be here, and the wrong person
    finding you could end in trouble. You draw in a deep breath to calm yourself
    and look them over."
