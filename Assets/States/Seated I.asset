  storyText: "Going by logic, unstrapping yourself would probably end up with you
    on the floor like Hafinson. Besides, the crew have been working with this ship
    for who knows how long. They\u2019ll notice soon enough, right? \n\nA moment
    passes before your thoughts are interuppted by a second explosion, just as large
    as the first, coming from the engine bay. Hopefully the captain wasn\u2019t close
    by, or your ass is done for.\n\nMaybe you should go check on him, but staying
    out of the area would probably be safer.....what do you want to do?"
  optionOne: "\u201CThis could not have gone any worse....\u201D"
  optionTwo: Go to the pilot
