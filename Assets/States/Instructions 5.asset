  storyText: "It\u2019s the year 2xxx, and your sister works for a large mining corporation
    known as Langly Corp. She\u2019s employed as part of their survey team that travels
    across the galaxy, which you think is pretty cool, but something happened to
    the expedition team she was leading, and now she\u2019s missing. \n\nHer company
    really hasn\u2019t done anything about the mishap, and by the looks of things,
    doesn\u2019t care enough about her to do anything anytime soon. \n\nAs a result,
    you have spent your life savings buying a ship and hiring your own crew to go
    search. The story continues as you reach your destination."
