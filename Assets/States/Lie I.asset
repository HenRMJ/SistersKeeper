  storyText: "The captain glances back over at the pilot, who simply shrugs. \n\n\u201DI\u2019m....honestly
    not sure what the restrictions are. I would\u2019ve done more research if I had
    known we were going to Panzol, but I only read an outline for Krestar before
    we set off.\u201D The pilot still doesn\u2019t look away from their controls.\n\nThe
    captain shakes his head, turning back to you once again with a defeated look.
